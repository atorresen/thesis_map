			<td><span class="tt">authority, anarchy<span class="ttt">
					The most common way people lose power is
					by thinking they don't have it.
					<br>
					Inspired by the teaching philosophies of Mariela Yeregui, Alice Plane,
					Houman Harouni, Jacques Rancière, etc., I'm interested in breaking down
					traditional assumptions about who holds authority, both in
					classrooms and (by extension, perhaps via heterotopia) the broader world.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">climate change<span class="ttt">
					The climate crisis is urgent and yet many people don't know
					what they can do about it or who is going to "fix" it.
					My art (and the rest of my life) is low-waste. Living
					<a href="https://zerowaste.org/">"zero waste"</a>
					gives me a tangible foothold in the fight against
					climate-change-related fatigue/uncertainty.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">multicultural education<span class="ttt">
					For my undergraduate thesis, I wrote about the need to build
					confusion/uncertainty/a plurality of stories into K-12 curriculums
					to combat "the master narrative of US history" beyond just
					superficial holidays or international nights.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">decolonialism<span class="ttt">
					Colonialism is violent, fatal, oppressive, restrictive, etc.
					Also, I've built myself in the world as it is, and gotten used
					to privileges and challenges as I experience them.
					Interpreting decolonialsm as a need to break all of my mental
					habits and to question anything I hold certain is good and
					also can introduce debilitating uncertainty.

			<td><span class="tt">brain fog<span class="ttt">

				<h1 class="tt">CONSTRAINT<span class="ttt">
						Feeling overwhelmed be the enormous uncertainty of
						studying art, I found solace in the <em>constraint</em>.
						Defining a constraint can reduce an overwhelming
						problem into a manageable task. But don't think that
						the imposition of a constraint reduces potential
						complexity! On the contrary, constraints are fertile ground
						for complexity, creativity, and self-expression.

		<tr>
			<td><span class="tt">mathematical<span class="ttt">
					There are many examples of mathematical constraints. Some that interest
					me include: ciphers, axiomatic reasoning, cellular automata, computation,
					isometry, integers and divisibility.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">small rules<span class="ttt">
					Small rules expand into vast complexity.
					A canonical example of this is John Conway's Game of Life,
					which is a special case of Cellular Automata. The study of
					small rules and the crazy behavior that ensues from
					repeatedly applying them was coined
					<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/">"Ruliology"</a>
					by Stephen Wolfram.
					"Rules" can also be interpreted more broadly as a set of
					shared and/or imposed assumptions (in math, these are called "axioms"),
					which can range in specifity and purposes.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">strange loops<span class="ttt">
					Douglas Hofstadter's book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid
					centers on the idea of self-referential feedback loops, and their
					prevelance in mathematican Gödel's logic (and his famous Incompleteness
					Theorem), artist Escher's drawings, and composer Bach's music.

					Also, Michel Foucault writes about heterotopias and the idea that
					small windows of experience can mirror larger or smaller ones at
					different scales. There can be levels to things where the levels
					are all structurally the same.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">the art itself<span class="ttt">
					The constraint IS the art. I'm inspired by the
					<a href="http://oulipo.net/fr/">Ouvrior de littérature potentielle (OuLiPo)</a>
					and their development of poetic constraints, which
					are often mathematically-inspired. The group creates not just finished
					works of writing, but constraints that serve as templates for further
					(i.e., potential) work.
				</span></span></td>
			<td><span class="tt">psychological guiderail<span class="ttt">
					You can sometimes most easily do something while doing something else.
					Focusing on satisfying a constraint can be front-and-center
					in the mind, allowing semi/sub-conscious processes to reveal
					themselves in our periphery.
					For example, you may find it hard to write a love poem directly, but if you start
					writing poems with strict mathematical constraints, you may find
					that they all turn out to be about love.

				<span class="ttt">
					The
					<a href="https://oeis.org/A000002">Kolakoski sequence</a>
					is both an example of how a small rule
					leads to complexity and of a self-referential (strange-loop-y)
					integer sequence.
					<br>
					I think this sequence could be the basis of a construction for the
					thesis show. At its heart (as I see it), the
					Kolakoski sequence demonstrates how we work endlessly to describe
					an unattainable yet well-defined self.
					<br>
					The sequence was popularized by William Kolakoski, who was a mathematician
					who went to art school. I visited the
					<a href="https://findingaids.library.cmu.edu/repositories/2/resources/122">
						Kolakoski Collection
					</a>
					at Carnegie Melon University this summer to read through some of his
					notes and drawings, and I felt quite validated that a lot of it
					really resonated with me.
