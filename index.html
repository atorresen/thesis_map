	Midterm crit reflections:
	<ul>
		<li>art is not to say what is right/wrong, but to confront people with their own ways of thinking</li>
		<li>start with curiousity, think (slowly) about questions, go in the direction set by the artist (take some time to start moving in it), find questions you are stuck on</li>
		<li>Be brief. Don't be too brief.</li>
		<li>give just enough context for people to arrive at main ideas on their own</li>
		<li>why is art dumb? what isn't dumb? (functional, logical, rational vs poetic, inefficient)</li>
		<li>math as a way of thinking/habit of mind (à la Su's <em>Math for Human Flourishing</em>)</li>
		<li>how to engage classmates who don't participate? (don't move forward without 100%)</li>
		<li>experiencing vs teaching; viewing art (or classrooms) == co-creation</li>
		<li><em>strange loopy-ness of "an artist can't hide behind the truth" : deciphering quote = disproving quote</em></li>
		<ul><li>being seen but not being understood; existing protected</li></ul>

	Notes from meeting with Pat Boland:

	<ul>

		<li>Obs: the Kolakoski sequence as I'm writing it (as a single list) is an "infinite
		fixed point" of the Kolakoski substitution rule ==> continue to explore Kolakoski sequence as a substitution sequence</li>
		<br>
		<li> <em>how to describe the phenomenon in Kolakoski that I am attracted to?</em>
			what distinguishes it from other substitution sequences (e.g., Morse-Thue)?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>index in self reference increments (unlike Fibonacci or see-and-say, which
					refer back just to the directly previous term(s)); spiraling forward vs looking back a set (small) amount</li>
				<li>==> Q: does this phenomenon arise in any example with simpler substitution rules?</li>
				<br>
			</ul>
			<li>consider f(n) = index of the first number you <em>write</em> as a function
			of the index <em>n</em> that you <em>reference</em> </li>
			<ul>
				<li>f(n) approximating 3n/2 could be equivalent to saying the density of 1s and 2s are the same</li>

	<h6>a current summary of my work, which I've been trying to communicate in a meaningful way to people I'm introducing to the project:</h6>
	<p>
		There are 2 parts to the thesis project: a written paper and a physical object.
		<br><br>
		The D+M program focuses on "research-based art", so we're simultaneously doing research and doing art projects
		(whatever form those take), which inform each other in sort of a repetitive, overlapping process.
		<br><br>
		Conceptually (for the paper), I'm reflecting on this art-research process as I do it, and broadening it as a way
		to think about learning math. Specifically, I'm interested in self-reference and strange loops, and the
		feeling of moving back-and-forth between different "parts" as a way of moving forward (in time or space or
		understanding). I'm referencing sources from math, pedagogy, philosophy, psychology, etc.
		<br><br>
		For the physical object, I'm using the Kolakoski sequence as a blueprint for folding a wire structure,
		and I'm thinking about how the process of embodying/physically constructing a mathematical object is a
		form of research, self-reflection, and "knowledge"-creation. I chose the Kolakoski sequence in particular
		because it embodies the phenomenon of repetitive, overlapping self-reference, which in turn supports
		my interests in "strange loops" and how similar patterns are nested within each other, allowing us to
		"do something <em>here</em> to do something else <em>there</em>", or think about a thing in multiple
		ways at the same time.
		<br><br>
		Emphasizing a "back-and-forth" motion/gesture is helping me ground the confusing theory in a general form.
		I find that back-and-forth/oscillation/"alternating with the contrary" describes many aspects of my work:
		moving between art and math, between reading and writing, between researching and making, between thinking and doing,
		between showing and hiding, between sunrise and sunset, between inhaling and exhaling, between poles of
		psychological conflicts, etc. These not-quite-"binaries" (math/art, research/creation, theory/praxis, etc.)
		blur as I hop and get lost between them.

	Misc notes from the past week-ish:

	<ul>
		<li>thesis = back-and-forth between reflection and creation, feedback loop, nutritional for each other</li>
		<li>draft of abstract:</li>
		<blockquote cite="http://">
			1 <br>
			I propose creative expression as a valuable dimension of mathematical rigor and as a pedagogical tool that can bring joy and open-endedness into advanced math classrooms. By emphasizing the poetic frameworks already present in the study of mathematics and by broadening academically-accepted ways of “understanding” and “knowing,” we (yes, you too!) can do and share math in beautiful, expressive, artistic ways.

			<li>repetitive gesture</li>
			<li>process of making is consistent with the concept</li>

	Notes from "Geometry of Uncertainty" conference:

	<h6>Day 1</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>bring math into a tangible aesthetic form -- not necessarily physical, but "feel-able"</li>
		<li>express meaning in a visual form so it can be shared in a public place</li>
		<li>"living questions" (Rainer Maria Rilke <a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/klineasrilkeletters.php">Letters to a Young Poet</a>)</li>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/klineasrilkeletters.php">
			"have patience with everything unresolved in your heart
			and try to love <em>the questions themselves</em> as if they were locked rooms or
			books penned in a language most foreign to you. Don’t search for answers
			now that cannot be given because you could not live them. And it is about
			living it all. <em>Live</em> the questions now."
		</blockquote>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<h6>Day 2</h6>
	working between knowing and not-knowing
	<ul>
		<li>alternation with the contrary</li>
		<ul>
			<li>back-and-forth moves you forward (contrast to means-driven deductive reasoning)</li>
			<li>cycle between states; rise and return (as breathing)</li>
			<li>arrive at a conclusion that is the opposite of the original axiom</li>
			<li>transpose a task into another domain</li>
		</ul>
		<li>reason = faith in deduction/intelligibility</li>
		<li>[this talk offers little resolution/rhetoric; it is a vague proposal but no tied-with-a-bow message]</li>
		<li>tension/constraint creates opportunity for flux (Jung's <em>Seven Sermons to the Dead</em> and <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em>)</li>
		<li>embrace generative-ness of dreams, mistakes, flaws, deviations</li>
		<li>disorder vs carelessness (<a href="https://cityterritoryarchitecture.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40410-022-00152-7">Aldo Rossi</a>)</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote cite="https://monoskop.org/images/1/18/Rossi_Aldo_A_Scientific_Autobiography.pdf">
		"I felt that the disorder of things, if limited and somehow honest, might best correspond
		to our state of mind. But I detested the arbitrary disorder that is an indifference
		to order, a kind of moral obtuseness, complactent well-being, forgetfulness."
	</blockquote>

	<ul>
		<li>use math techniques/tools to transform (how we do) art</li>
		<ul>
			<li>TODO: make a list of math tools</li>
		</ul>
		<li>reassemble/reconfigure to create multiple responses to a constraint ("computational reuse")</li>
		<li>note: short essays are nice; create easy reading assignments! :)</li>
		<li>move math away from symbolic manipulation and toward image/feeling/experience</li>
		<li>[this talk has only two slides and has the feeling of being unrehearsed (great if you can pull it off)]</li>
	</ul>

	<h6>reminders:</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>I am soft, nuturing, local, non-industrial, confused, small</li>
		<li>uncomfortable in the unstructured but at home with the abstract</li>
		<li>math is universal because it defines its own universe; math is incomplete because it defines itself</li>
		<li>art = entry point to advanced/abstract/theoretical/poetic math (at least the feeling of it)</li>
	</ul>

	Notes from meeting with Adela:

	<ul>
		<li>threads/fraying of fabric is nice, keep "imperfections" so that the pattern looks "perfect"/concrete from a distance but softer up close</li>
		<ul>
			<li>different types of rigor (perhaps less academic/mathematical rigor, but still artistic rigor in precise folds, systematic approach, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>conceptually: physical manifestation of an abstract idea (which reveals an implied split between mind and body)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>...we always try to split things into opposites (e.g., abstract/concrete)</li>

		<li>this work is a proof/example that new (mathematical) knowledge can come in many forms (i.e., mind or body) --> pedagogy</li>
		<ul>
			<li>building the sequence is a conscious process of bodily learning (in contrast to rote repetition, like in an assembly line)</li>

	<h5>4 Sep 2025</h5>
	This is a research semester. The goal is to build a continuous body of work
	that will become a thesis (and to evaluate how/if to incorporate existing work).
	The written part of the thesis will be (mostly) complete by the end of this semester;
	the Spring semester is for final touches.
	<ul>
		<li>find a balance of research, writing, and prototyping</li>
		<li>the thesis need not be an academic paper; it should be part of the art</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>TODO (short term):</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>comment on 5 thesis maps in Are.na</li>
		<li>read D+M Writing Guidelines; review old theses</li>
		<li>prepare 10 min presentation of past work + thesis intentions for next Thursday</li>
		<li>keep documentation of thesis process, failures included [THIS WEBSITE IS IT]</li>
	</ul>
	<h6>TODO (semester):</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Biennial paintings</li>
		<li>Kolakoski line textile/installation</li>
		<br>
		<li>letterpress Your Choice covers</li>
		<li>teaching design/prep</li>
		<li>penplot cipher drawings</li>

		<li>consider who will serve on thesis committee</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Motivation</h5>
	This webpage is where I will review my handwritten notes from meetings/crits/classes.
	Reviewing/distilling the notes into key takeaways will help me process information
	so I can make lasting connections. I'll call it "notes on notes."
	Or maybe "A second pass," since the point is to go over my notes a second time
	relatively soon after I've taken them, so they do not go forgotten.
	Also, this is my "second pass" at starting at RISD, so I am celebrating second tries
	(which are also first tries in their own way).

					The most common way people lose power is
					by thinking they don't have it.
					<br>
					Inspired by the teaching philosophies of Mariela Yeregui, Alice Plane,
					Houman Harouni, Jacques Rancière, etc., I'm interested in breaking down
					traditional assumptions about who holds authority, both in
					classrooms and (by extension, perhaps via heterotopia) the broader world.

			<td class="map"><span class="tt">climate change<span class="ttt">
					The climate crisis is urgent and yet many people don't know
					what they can do about it or who is going to "fix" it.
					My art (and the rest of my life) is low-waste. Living
					<a href="https://zerowaste.org/">"zero waste"</a>

			<td class="map"><span class="tt">multicultural education<span class="ttt">
					For my undergraduate thesis, I wrote about the need to build
					confusion/uncertainty/a plurality of stories into K-12 curriculums
					to combat "the master narrative of US history" beyond just
					superficial holidays or international nights.
				</span></span></td>
			<td class="map"><span class="tt">decolonialism<span class="ttt">
					Colonialism is violent, fatal, oppressive, restrictive, etc.
					Also, I've built myself in the world as it is, and gotten used
					to privileges and challenges as I experience them.
					Interpreting decolonialsm as a need to break all of my mental
					habits and to question anything I hold certain is good and
					also can introduce debilitating uncertainty.

				<h1 class="tt">CONSTRAINT<span class="ttt">
						Feeling overwhelmed be the enormous uncertainty of
						studying art, I found solace in the <em>constraint</em>.
						Defining a constraint can reduce an overwhelming
						problem into a manageable task. But don't think that
						the imposition of a constraint reduces potential
						complexity! On the contrary, constraints are fertile ground
						for complexity, creativity, and self-expression.

			<td class="map"><span class="tt">mathematical<span class="ttt">
					There are many examples of mathematical constraints. Some that interest
					me include: ciphers, axiomatic reasoning, cellular automata, computation,
					isometry, integers and divisibility.
				</span></span></td>
			<td class="map"><span class="tt">small rules<span class="ttt">
					Small rules expand into vast complexity.
					A canonical example of this is John Conway's Game of Life,
					which is a special case of Cellular Automata. The study of
					small rules and the crazy behavior that ensues from
					repeatedly applying them was coined
					<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/">"Ruliology"</a>
					by Stephen Wolfram.
					"Rules" can also be interpreted more broadly as a set of
					shared and/or imposed assumptions (in math, these are called "axioms"),
					which can range in specifity and purposes.
				</span></span></td>
			<td class="map"><span class="tt">strange loops<span class="ttt">
					Douglas Hofstadter's book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid
					centers on the idea of self-referential feedback loops, and their
					prevelance in mathematican Gödel's logic (and his famous Incompleteness
					Theorem), artist Escher's drawings, and composer Bach's music.

					Also, Michel Foucault writes about heterotopias and the idea that
					small windows of experience can mirror larger or smaller ones at
					different scales. There can be levels to things where the levels
					are all structurally the same.
				</span></span></td>
			<td class="map"><span class="tt">the art itself<span class="ttt">
					The constraint IS the art. I'm inspired by the
					<a href="http://oulipo.net/fr/">Ouvrior de littérature potentielle (OuLiPo)</a>
					and their development of poetic constraints, which
					are often mathematically-inspired. The group creates not just finished
					works of writing, but constraints that serve as templates for further
					(i.e., potential) work.
				</span></span></td>
			<td class="map"><span class="tt">psychological guiderail<span class="ttt">
					You can sometimes most easily do something while doing something else.
					Focusing on satisfying a constraint can be front-and-center
					in the mind, allowing semi/sub-conscious processes to reveal
					themselves in our periphery.
					For example, you may find it hard to write a love poem directly, but if you start
					writing poems with strict mathematical constraints, you may find
					that they all turn out to be about love.

					The
					<a href="https://oeis.org/A000002">Kolakoski sequence</a>
					is both an example of how a small rule
					leads to complexity and of a self-referential (strange-loop-y)
					integer sequence.
					<br>
					I think this sequence could be the basis of a construction for the
					thesis show. At its heart (as I see it), the
					Kolakoski sequence demonstrates how we work endlessly to describe
					an unattainable yet well-defined self.
					<br>
					The sequence was popularized by William Kolakoski, who was a mathematician
					who went to art school. I visited the
					<a href="https://findingaids.library.cmu.edu/repositories/2/resources/122">
						Kolakoski Collection
					</a>
					at Carnegie Melon University this summer to read through some of his
					notes and drawings, and I felt quite validated that a lot of it
					really resonated with me.
