		Notes from meeting with Adela:

		<ul>
			<li>threads/fraying of fabric is nice, keep "imperfections" so that the pattern looks "perfect"/concrete from a distance but softer up close</li>
			<ul>
				<li>different types of rigor (perhaps less academic/mathematical rigor, but still artistic rigor in precise folds, systematic approach, etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>conceptually: physical manifestation of an abstract idea (which reveals an implied split between mind and body)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>...we always try to split things into opposites (e.g., abstract/concrete)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>this work is a proof/example that new (mathematical) knowledge can come in many forms (i.e., mind or body) --> pedagogy</li>
			<ul>
				<li>building the sequence is a conscious process of bodily learning (in contrast to rote repetition, like in an assembly line)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>use 2D pieces to create something 3D by accumulation (neater/nicer than random wire attempt)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>a pattern inside a pattern inside a pattern... "it's meta but it's not meta because it is the same thing" (me: "yes!!")</li>
				</ul>
			<li>references/connections:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://danielburen.com/artworks/permanent">Daniel Buren (pattern aesthetics)</a></li>
				<li>counting with physical beads -- abacus, rosary</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h6>TODOs</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>continue making-thinking :)</li>
			<li>experiment with materials at scale</li>
			<li>choose rules in computer model, explore how rules create the architecture</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>21 Sep 2025</h5>
		Update : <em>back-and-forth</em>
		<ul>
			<li>a game of catch</li>
			<li>a tossing and turning</li>
			<li>between disciplines</li>
			<li>strange loops</li>
			<li>practice, play, movement</li>
			<li>teaching, learning, creating, thinking, making == looping</li>
			<li>CBTWYSINTSANHL</li>
		</ul>

		<h6>proposed research questions</h6>
		<p>How can repeated back-and-forth gestures accumulate into new knowledge?</p>
		<p>How can embodying math develop mathematical understanding beyond academic rigor?</p>
		<p>What is the interplay between constraint and expression in mathematical and artistic practices?</p>

		<h6>these ideas might be good eventually</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>write another Accumulating Kolakoski poem to start/end thesis with the same structure</li>
			<li>enormous Venn diagram with intersections magnified (hyperbolic?) to emphasize connected > separate</li>
		</ul>

		<h6>Installation planning (in progress)</h6>

		<h5>18 Sep 2025</h5>
		Notes from class discussion: defining "research-creation"
		<ul>
			<li>definition take 1: “only knows the conditions of its existence from within its own process” (Manning), i.e., can’t define it in specifics</li>
			<li>definition take 2: dynamic combination of thinking and making (i.e., philosophy and art), where each informs the other and the output is further inquiry</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>"insertion of voices and practices into the academic everyday that work to trouble disciplinary relays of knowledge/power, allowing for more creative, sensually attuned modes of inhabiting the university" (Loveless)</li>
			<li>“reframing how knowledge is practiced beyond typical forms of academic use-value, including the value we place on linguistic expression and language-based evaluation” (Manning)</li>
			<li>“we live in a world that privileges forms of perception where the part can quickly and easily be singled out from the whole” (Manning) ← what can be gained by releasing this?</li>
		</ul>

		art = creating new (ways of) knowledge
		<ul>
			<li>blend research/creation, thinking/making, mind/senses</li>
			<li>academia offers "legitimacy"... what do we want to take from academia?
				what do we want to resist? what do we want to bring?</li>
		</ul>

		art/research emphasizes:
		<ul>
			<li>process</li>
			<li>interdisciplinarity</li>
			<li>collective/public communication</li>
			<li>sensory experience > rigorous expertise</li>
			<li>questions > answers</li>

		Notes from meeting with Mariela:

		<ul>
			<li>what behaviors will the installation trigger?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>do you want the audience to observe it? touch it? reshape it?</li>
				<li>include puzzles/toys within the installation</li>
			</ul>
			<li>concept: tiny things coalesce into a structure/system</li>
			<li>relate (in writing) trash materiality to concept of feedback loop/circularity</li>
			<li>consider sound -- perhaps a subtle murmur</li>
		</ul>

		<img src="images/wire_test.png" alt="images/wire_test.png" style="height: 300px">
		<br><br>
		General notes:
		<ul>
			<li>understanding the Kolakoski sequence = reading it in two ways at the
			same time (terms & blocks, recipe & result)
		</li>
		<li>the installation may be beautiful and poetic, but how to <em>point to</em> the math?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(Mariela's advice: think about what the audience will <em>do</em>)</li>
			</ul>
		<li>interpret Kolakoski with morse code?</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>11 Sep 2025</h5>
		Notes from Sam as "devils advocate":
		<br>
		<a href="https://www.are.na/block/39474469?blockId=39474469&blockProfileId=mariela-yeregui&blockChannelId=studio_seminar_3_2025&mode=Show&intent=title">(Also posted in Are.na)</a>
		<ul>
			<li>ok, but what about it?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>how to incorporate self-referential loops/other theory visually?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>can the vague/minimal visual be <em>steered in a specific direction</em>?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>i.e., instead of randomness</li>
			</ul>
			<li>contrast/mix of exact math and messy language (also music?)</li>
			<li>make more grounded, inviting, contextual, connected to the world</li>
		</ul>

		<h6>notes to self:</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>to me, the math/process <em>is</em> the grounding element (relative to "art"/concepts);
			constraint, small rules, base cases, tangible physicality... these all ground abstract
			math concepts (which may settle in the periphery while the physical work preoccupies you)</li>
			<br>
			<li>I really like this devil's advocate/sharing in pairs format! recreate (with a CFU to clarify "devils advocate")</li>
			<br>
			<li>potential writing topic: loops & landing (have I landed (conceptually) in the perfect places?
				have I crafted my arrivals? have I built myself around where I have landed? chicken/egg of inspiration)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>should I start with an example or with a broad concept? loop between them! (I can start at either, they loop, they drive eachother)</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>

			<h6>TODOs from Sam:</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>read college Kolakoski paper</li>
				<li>explain a system without using any words</li>
			</ul>

			<h6>Reminder from Mariela:</h6>
			The thesis is a research project, not trying to solve an art project.

			<h6>References offered during presentation:</h6>
			<ul>

		<h5>9 Sep 2025</h5>
		Idea for thesis structure: series of poems/essays that alternate to mimic
		the Kolakoski sequence
		<ol>
			<li>(1) poem - compliance</li>
			<li>(2) essay - constraint & uncertainty</li>
			<li>(2) essay - intro to Kolakoski sequence</li>
			<li>(1) poem - accumulating Kolakoski</li>
			<li>(1) poem - TBD</li>
			<li>(2) essay - strange loops & hierarchies</li>
			<li>(1) poem - TBD</li>
			<li>(2) essay - TBD</li>
			<li>(2) essay - teaching math</li>
			<li>(1) poem - TBD</li>
		</ol>
		tossing back and forth, trying to explain each other, open/unsolved question
		what they converge to (ratio of math/art? poem/prose?)

		<h6>structure requirements (from D+M writing guidelines):</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>2500-4000 words total</li>
			<li>150-250 word abstract</li>
			<li><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5979f27e579fb3cca0a88824/t/64b82e27badb2d3340b68089/1689792040086/Masters+Written+Thesis+Handbook.pdf">
				thesis-writing handbook</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h6>Notes from meeting with Adela:</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>constraints are always there; our beings/ideologies are constraints;
			the constraints I am naming are small</li>
			<li>does mathematical proof definitively end speculation in a way not possible in other sciences?</li>
			<li>how can the materiality of the thesis sculpture connect to themes of pedagogy/engagement/nurturing/love?
			how to invite people in?</li>
			<li>TODO: start experimenting with 3D sculpture/scale using <em>wire</em></li>
		</ul>

		<h5>4 Sep 2025</h5>
		This is a research semester. The goal is to build a continuous body of work
		that will become a thesis (and to evaluate how/if to incorporate existing work).
		The written part of the thesis will be (mostly) complete by the end of this semester;
		the Spring semester is for final touches.
		<ul>
			<li>find a balance of research, writing, and prototyping</li>
			<li>the thesis need not be an academic paper; it should be part of the art</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>TODO (short term):</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>comment on 5 thesis maps in Are.na</li>
			<li>read D+M Writing Guidelines; review old theses</li>
			<li>prepare 10 min presentation of past work + thesis intentions for next Thursday</li>
			<li>keep documentation of thesis process, failures included [THIS WEBSITE IS IT]</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>TODO (semester):</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Biennial paintings</li>
			<li>Kolakoski line textile/installation</li>
			<br>
			<li>letterpress Your Choice covers</li>
			<li>teaching design/prep</li>
			<li>penplot cipher drawings</li>
			<br>
			<li>consider who will serve on thesis committee</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Motivation</h5>
		This is where I will review my handwritten notes from meetings/crits/classes.
		Reviewing/distilling the notes into key takeaways will help me process information
		so I can make lasting connections. I'll call it "notes on notes."
		Or maybe "A second pass," since the point is to go over my notes a second time
		relatively soon after I've taken them, so they do not go forgotten.
		Also, this is my "second pass" at starting at RISD, so I am celebrating second tries
		(which are also first tries in their own way).
