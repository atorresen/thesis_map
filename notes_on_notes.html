		<h5>4 Sep 2025</h5>
		This is a research semester. The goal is to build a continuous body of work
		that will become a thesis (and to evaluate how/if to incorporate existing work).
		The written part of the thesis will be (mostly) complete by the end of this semester;
		the Spring semester is for final touches.
		<ul>
			<li>find a balance of research, writing, and prototyping</li>
			<li>the thesis need not be an academic paper; it should be part of the art</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>TODO (short term):</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>comment on 5 thesis maps in Are.na</li>
			<li>read D+M Writing Guidelines; review old theses</li>
			<li>prepare 10 min presentation of past work + thesis intentions for next Thursday</li>
			<li>keep documentation of thesis process, failures included [THIS WEBSITE IS IT]</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>TODO (semester):</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Biennial paintings</li>
			<li>Kolakoski line textile/installation</li>
			<br>
			<li>letterpress Your Choice covers</li>
			<li>teaching design/prep</li>
			<li>penplot cipher drawings</li>
			<br>
			<li>consider who will serve on thesis committee</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Motivation</h5>
		This is where I will review my handwritten notes from meetings/crits/classes.
		Reviewing/distilling the notes into key takeaways will help me process information
		so I can make lasting connections. I'll call it "notes on notes."
		Or maybe "A second pass," since the point is to go over my notes a second time
		relatively soon after I've taken them, so they do not go forgotten.
		Also, this is my "second pass" at starting at RISD, so I am celebrating second tries
		(which are also first tries in their own way).
